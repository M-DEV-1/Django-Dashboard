# Django Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project is a web-based dashboard application built using Django. It provides users with a comprehensive interface to perform CRUD on data records.
This project helped me in becoming better at Django, with CRUD and APIs.

## Technologies Used
- Django
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- SQLite (Django in-built database)


## Note:
 I have deleted the in-built SQLite3 database<br><br>
```python manage.py makemigrations``` <br>
```python manage.py migrate``` <br><br>
use this to make all necessary migrations into a new database
